# Setting Up Test Data for Audio ‚Üí Editor Integration Test

The test requires an existing audio project with completed transcription. Here are quick ways to set it up:

## Option 1: Use Your Existing Data

If you already have the "test" project with "Kaaritorpantie - Rainer 4min.mp3" transcribed:

1. Make sure backend and frontend are running:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload

   # Terminal 2
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/audio

3. Select the "test" project

4. You should see "Kaaritorpantie - Rainer 4min.mp3" with transcription

5. Run the test:
   ```bash
   ./run-audio-editor-integration-test.sh
   ```

## Option 2: Quick Manual Setup (5-10 minutes)

1. Start services (if not running):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload

   # Terminal 2
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:5173/audio

3. Create a new audio project:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name: "E2E Test Project"
   - Click "Create"

4. Upload a test audio file:
   - Use `tests/e2e/assets/Kaartintorpantie-clip.m4a`
   - Or any short audio file you have

5. Start transcription:
   - Click "Start Transcription"
   - Select "tiny" model (fastest)
   - Uncheck diarization (faster)
   - Click "Start"
   - Wait ~1-2 minutes for completion

6. Run the test:
   ```bash
   ./run-audio-editor-integration-test.sh
   ```

## Option 3: Use Existing "test" Project

If you have the "test" project but need to select it:

1. Go to http://localhost:5173/audio

2. In the project selector dropdown, select "test"

3. Check if "Kaaritorpantie - Rainer 4min.mp3" has transcription
   - Look for the "Open in Editor" button
   - If present, transcription is complete!

4. Run the test:
   ```bash
   ./run-audio-editor-integration-test.sh
   ```

## What the Test Expects

The test will:
1. Navigate to `/audio`
2. Look for the first file card
3. Check if "Open in Editor" button exists
4. If found ‚Üí run the test
5. If not found ‚Üí skip gracefully (as you just saw)

## Current Status

Based on your test output:
```
[STEP 2] ‚ö†Ô∏è No audio files found - test requires existing transcription
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Test is working correctly
- ‚úÖ Local dev mode is active (port 5173)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No audio project is currently selected OR no files in the project
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to either select "test" project or create new test data

## Quick Fix

The fastest way is probably to just select the "test" project in your browser:

1. Open http://localhost:5173/audio
2. In the top bar, select "test" from the project dropdown
3. Verify you see "Kaaritorpantie - Rainer 4min.mp3"
4. Run the test again

That should make it pass! üéØ
