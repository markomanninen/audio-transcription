# Complete Fix Summary - October 20, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes all critical fixes applied during the October 20, 2025 debugging session to resolve UI status inconsistencies, data cleanup issues, and frontend state management problems.

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Status API Returning Incorrect Data ✅

**Problem**: The `/api/transcription/{file_id}/status` endpoint returned "pending" with "model_ready_to_load" when the transcription service singleton wasn't initialized, even though files were actively processing at 50%+ completion.

**Root Cause**: The endpoint checked `is_transcription_service_ready()` and assumed "not ready" meant "no active transcriptions", which was incorrect. Transcriptions can run via background tasks even when the singleton isn't fully initialized.

**Fix**: [backend/app/api/transcription.py:696-723](../../backend/app/api/transcription.py#L696-L723)

```python
if not is_transcription_service_ready():
    # CRITICAL FIX: If file is already processing, completed, or failed, return actual data from database
    if audio_file.transcription_status in (TranscriptionStatus.PROCESSING, TranscriptionStatus.COMPLETED, TranscriptionStatus.FAILED):
        segment_count = db.query(Segment).filter(Segment.audio_file_id == file_id).count()

        progress_value = audio_file.transcription_progress or 0.0
        if audio_file.transcription_status == TranscriptionStatus.COMPLETED:
            progress_value = 1.0

        return TranscriptionStatusResponse(
            file_id=audio_file.id,
            status=audio_file.transcription_status.value.lower(),
            progress=progress_value,
            processing_stage=audio_file.transcription_stage,
            # ... return all database fields
        )
```

**Impact**: API now always returns accurate status from database for active transcriptions, regardless of service singleton state.

**Related**: [TRANSCRIPTION_STATUS_FIX.md](./TRANSCRIPTION_STATUS_FIX.md)

---

### 2. Automatic WAV File Cleanup ✅

**Problem**: Converted WAV files (`*_converted.wav`) were never automatically deleted after transcription, wasting disk space (103.81 MB found during debugging).

**Root Cause**: The transcription service created temporary WAV files for non-WAV audio formats but had no cleanup logic after success or failure.

**Fix**: [backend/app/services/transcription_service.py](../../backend/app/services/transcription_service.py)

**On Success (Lines 991-999)**:
```python
# CRITICAL: Clean up converted WAV file after successful transcription
if audio_file.audio_transformation_path and audio_file.audio_transformation_path != audio_file.file_path:
    try:
        if os.path.exists(audio_file.audio_transformation_path):
            os.remove(audio_file.audio_transformation_path)
            transcription_logger.info(f"🗑️  Cleaned up converted file: {audio_file.audio_transformation_path}")
    except Exception as cleanup_error:
        transcription_logger.warning(f"Failed to clean up converted file: {cleanup_error}")
```

**On Failure (Lines 1031-1038)**:
```python
# CRITICAL: Clean up converted WAV file on failure to prevent disk space waste
if audio_file.audio_transformation_path and audio_file.audio_transformation_path != audio_file.file_path:
    try:
        if os.path.exists(audio_file.audio_transformation_path):
            os.remove(audio_file.audio_transformation_path)
            transcription_logger.info(f"🗑️  Cleaned up converted file after failure: {audio_file.audio_transformation_path}")
    except Exception as cleanup_error:
        transcription_logger.warning(f"Failed to clean up converted file: {cleanup_error}")
```

**Impact**:
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files prevents disk space waste
- No manual cleanup scripts needed
- 103MB saved immediately after implementation

**User Feedback**: *"make sure application removed automaticly files, this is fucking idiotic routine"*

---

### 3. Cascade File Deletion ✅

**Problem**: Deleting a parent file didn't delete child split files, speakers, or converted WAV files, leaving orphaned data in database and disk.

**Root Cause**: The delete endpoint only cleaned up segments and LLM logs, not child files or related speaker records.

**Fix**: [backend/app/api/upload.py:334-431](../../backend/app/api/upload.py#L334-L431)

```python
# Collect all file IDs to delete (this file + any child split files)
file_ids_to_delete = [file_id]
child_files = db.query(AudioFile).filter(AudioFile.parent_audio_file_id == file_id).all()
file_ids_to_delete.extend([child.id for child in child_files])

for fid in file_ids_to_delete:
    # 1. Delete LLM logs (foreign key to segments)
    # 2. Collect speaker IDs from segments
    # 3. Delete segments (foreign key to audio_file)
    # 4. Delete speakers (now safe, no FK constraints)
    # 5. Delete physical files (original + converted)

    # Delete converted WAV files
    base_path = os.path.splitext(audio_file_to_delete.file_path)[0]
    converted_wav = f"{base_path}_converted.wav"
    if os.path.exists(converted_wav):
        os.remove(converted_wav)

    # Delete original file
    if os.path.exists(audio_file_to_delete.file_path):
        os.remove(audio_file_to_delete.file_path)

    # 6. Delete database record
    db.delete(audio_file_to_delete)
```

**Impact**:
- Complete cleanup of parent + all child files
- No orphaned speakers, segments, or LLM logs
- Disk space properly reclaimed

**Related**: [FILE_DELETE_CASCADE_FIX.md](./FILE_DELETE_CASCADE_FIX.md)

---

### 4. Split Dialog Modal Stuck Open ✅

**Problem**: Split batch dialog remained open after timeout errors, even when split succeeded.

**Fix**: [frontend/src/components/Dashboard/SplitBatchDialog.tsx:111](../../frontend/src/components/Dashboard/SplitBatchDialog.tsx#L111)

```typescript
catch (err: any) {
  const description = err?.response?.data?.detail || err?.message || 'Unable to split audio...'
  error('Split failed', description)
  onClose()  // ADDED: Close modal even on error
}
```

**Impact**: Modal properly closes regardless of error state.

---

### 5. File Selection Jumping Between Files ✅

**Problem**: During batch transcription, the UI kept switching between file 1/6 and 2/6 randomly, making it impossible to view progress.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` in AudioDashboardPage re-selected the first file every time `projectFiles` updated (which happened during polling), even if a file was already selected.

**Fix**: [frontend/src/pages/AudioDashboardPage.tsx:84-111](../../frontend/src/pages/AudioDashboardPage.tsx#L84-L111)

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (projectId && projectFiles && projectFiles.length > 0) {
    // CRITICAL FIX: Only auto-select if no file is currently selected
    if (selectedFileId !== null) {
      const currentFileExists = projectFiles.find((file) => file.file_id === selectedFileId);
      if (currentFileExists) {
        return; // Keep current selection if it still exists
      }
    }

    // Only auto-select first file if nothing is selected
    const firstFileId = projectFiles[0]?.file_id
    if (firstFileId !== undefined) {
      setSelectedFileId(firstFileId)
    }
  }
}, [projectId, projectFiles, selectedFileId]);
```

**Impact**: Selected file remains stable during polling updates.

**User Feedback**: *"why UI swtiches betweent these two states for no reason?"*

---

### 6. React Query Cache Staleness ✅

**Problem**: Frontend showed stale cache data (status: "pending") even though backend API returned fresh data (status: "PROCESSING" at 54%).

**Root Cause**: React Query's default cache behavior was too aggressive, and completed files were being polled unnecessarily.

**Fix**: [frontend/src/hooks/useTranscription.ts:113-158](../../frontend/src/hooks/useTranscription.ts#L113-L158)

```typescript
staleTime: (query) => {
  const status = query.state.data?.status
  if (status === 'completed' || status === 'failed') {
    return 30000  // 30 seconds for completed files
  }
  return 0  // Always stale for processing files
},
gcTime: 30000,
refetchInterval: (query) => {
  const status = query.state.data?.status
  const processingStage = query.state.data?.processing_stage

  if (pollInterval && status === 'processing') {
    return pollInterval
  }

  // CRITICAL FIX: Also poll if pending but has processing_stage
  // (service not ready but transcription is running)
  if (pollInterval && status === 'pending' && processingStage &&
      (processingStage.includes('loading') || processingStage.includes('queued'))) {
    return pollInterval
  }

  return false
},
refetchOnMount: (query) => {
  const status = query.state.data?.status
  return status === 'processing' || status === 'pending' ? 'always' : false
},
refetchOnWindowFocus: (query) => {
  const status = query.state.data?.status
  return status === 'processing' || status === 'pending'
}
```

**Impact**:
- Processing files poll every 2 seconds
- Completed files cache for 30 seconds (no unnecessary polling)
- Pending files with processing_stage also poll (catches singleton initialization lag)
- No refetch on mount/window focus for completed files (prevents flickering)

---

### 7. Batch Progress Overlay Stuck On Screen Forever ✅

**Problem**: After all 6 split files completed transcription, the batch progress overlay and toast notifications remained stuck on screen, never disappearing.

**Root Cause**: The auto-detection filter at line 93-98 included `'completed'` status, so even after all files finished, they were still detected as a "batch", keeping the overlay active forever.

**Fix**: [frontend/src/components/Dashboard/FileList.tsx:93-98](../../frontend/src/components/Dashboard/FileList.tsx#L93-L98)

**BEFORE**:
```typescript
const splitFiles = files.filter(file =>
  file.parent_audio_file_id &&
  (file.status === 'processing' || file.status === 'completed' || file.status === 'pending')
)
```

**AFTER**:
```typescript
// Find all split files (processing or pending ONLY) that could form a batch
// Don't include completed files - we only want active batches
const splitFiles = files.filter(file =>
  file.parent_audio_file_id &&
  (file.status === 'processing' || file.status === 'pending')
)
```

**Additional Fix**: Stop polling when batch complete (Lines 194-200):
```typescript
const shouldPollBatch = currentBatchFileId && !batchProgress?.isComplete
const { data: currentBatchStatus } = useTranscriptionStatus(
  currentBatchFileId,
  shouldPollBatch ? 2000 : undefined  // Only poll if batch not complete
)
```

**Impact**:
- Batch overlay appears when 2+ split files are processing/pending
- Overlay shows progress during transcription
- Overlay shows "Batch completed" when all files finish
- Overlay automatically disappears after 5 seconds
- No more stuck overlays or flickering

**User Feedback**: *"FRONT END FUCKIN GIDIOT SHITHLE... UI IS NOT OK;IT SHOWS ALL TTOAST AND BATCH PROGRESS PANELS FLOATING; WHCIS STICK ON THE SCREEN NEVEVER LEAVING!!!"*

---

### 8. Batch "Current File" Detection ✅

**Problem**: When multiple files in a batch have status "processing" simultaneously, the batch overlay incorrectly identified the first file as "current" even if another file was actually being transcribed.

**Example**: Files 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 all marked as "processing", but file 3/3 completed first (was actually being transcribed). File 1/3 showed "PROCESSING" badge while 2/3 and 3/3 showed "BATCH" badge, which was incorrect.

**Root Cause**: The `batchProgress` calculation (line 168) selected the **first** file with status `pending` or `processing` as the "current chunk", without checking which file was actually being transcribed.

**Fix**: [frontend/src/components/Dashboard/FileList.tsx:170-201](../../frontend/src/components/Dashboard/FileList.tsx#L170-L201)

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Find the ACTUAL current processing file by looking at
// most recent transcription_started_at timestamp
let processingFiles: Array<{ file: AudioFile; chunk: BatchChunk; index: number }> = []

activeBatch.chunks.forEach((chunk, index) => {
  const file = fileMap.get(chunk.fileId)
  const status = file?.status
  if (status === 'processing' || status === 'pending') {
    processingFiles.push({ file: file!, chunk, index })
  }
})

if (processingFiles.length > 0) {
  // Sort by transcription_started_at (most recent first)
  processingFiles.sort((a, b) => {
    const aStarted = a.file?.transcription_started_at
    const bStarted = b.file?.transcription_started_at

    // Files with start time come before files without
    if (aStarted && !bStarted) return -1
    if (!aStarted && bStarted) return 1
    if (!aStarted && !bStarted) return 0

    // Most recent start time first
    return new Date(bStarted).getTime() - new Date(aStarted).getTime()
  })

  // The first in sorted list is the actual current file
  const current = processingFiles[0]
  currentChunk = { file: current.file, chunk: current.chunk }
  currentIndex = current.index
}
```

**Impact**:
- Correctly identifies which file is ACTUALLY being transcribed
- Uses `transcription_started_at` timestamp to determine current file
- File with most recent start time shows "PROCESSING" badge
- Other batch files show "BATCH" badge
- Batch overlay auto-selects the correct current file

**User Feedback**: *"YOU DONT GET IT; THE LAST FILE GOT TRANSCRIBED FIRST"*

---

### 9. Transcription Stage Flickering ✅

**Problem**: The transcription progress UI showed two different `processing_stage` values that kept switching every second:
1. "loading_model" (stale)
2. "Transcribing audio - finalizing (530s) (long running)" (current)

**Example**: File showing "loading_model" for 1 second, then "Transcribing audio - finalizing (575s) (long running)" for 1 second, repeating indefinitely.

**Root Cause**: The backend was writing stage updates to the `error_message` field instead of the `transcription_stage` field. The status endpoint had backward compatibility code that tried to read from both fields, causing flickering as it alternated between the stale `transcription_stage` value and the current `error_message` value.

**Fix**: [backend/app/services/transcription_service.py](../../backend/app/services/transcription_service.py)

**Write Fix (Lines 242-247)**:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Update transcription_stage instead of error_message
audio_file.transcription_stage = stage_with_time
# Clear error_message if it was being used for stage info
if audio_file.error_message and audio_file.error_message.startswith("Stage: "):
    audio_file.error_message = None
db.commit()
```

**Read Fix (Lines 1082-1114)**:
```python
if audio_file.transcription_status == TranscriptionStatus.PROCESSING:
    # First check transcription_stage field (new location)
    stage_info = audio_file.transcription_stage

    # Fallback to error_message for backward compatibility (old location)
    if not stage_info and audio_file.error_message and audio_file.error_message.startswith("Stage: "):
        stage_info = audio_file.error_message[7:]  # Remove "Stage: " prefix
        error_message = None  # Don't show as error if it's stage info

    if stage_info:
        # Process stage info...
        processing_stage = stage_info
```

**Impact**:
- Stage updates now correctly written to `transcription_stage` field
- No more flickering between stale and current stage values
- Error messages properly separated from stage information
- Backward compatibility maintained for in-flight transcriptions

**User Feedback**: *"THIS IS A PROBLEM FUCKING IDIOT; FIX IT!!!"*

## 📊 Verification Steps

### Backend Status Endpoint
```bash
# 1. Check database status
docker exec transcribe-backend-1 python -c "
from app.core.database import SessionLocal
from app.models.audio_file import AudioFile
db = SessionLocal()
file = db.query(AudioFile).filter(AudioFile.id == 8).first()
print(f'Status: {file.transcription_status}')
print(f'Progress: {file.transcription_progress}')
db.close()
"

# 2. Check API status
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/transcription/8/status" | jq '{status, progress, processing_stage}'

# 3. Verify they match
```

### Automatic Cleanup
```bash
# 1. Start a transcription (creates converted WAV)
# 2. Wait for completion
# 3. Check logs for cleanup message
docker logs transcribe-backend-1 --tail 20 | grep "🗑️"

# Expected: "🗑️  Cleaned up converted file: /app/data/audio/xxx_converted.wav"
```

### Batch Overlay
```text
1. Upload an audio file (e.g., test-audio-30s.mp3)
2. Click "Split into 6 parts"
3. Click "Start All" to transcribe all 6 split files
4. Observe:
   - Batch overlay appears showing "6 files processing"
   - Progress updates in real-time
   - When all 6 complete, overlay shows "Batch completed: 6/6 successful"
   - Overlay disappears after 5 seconds
   - No flickering, no stuck panels
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database as Source of Truth
The key architectural principle reinforced by these fixes: **The database is the single source of truth for transcription status.**

- The transcription service singleton provides real-time progress updates during active processing
- If the singleton isn't ready/initialized, the API must fall back to database state
- Never assume "service not ready" means "no active transcriptions"

### React Query Cache Management
Proper cache configuration prevents UI inconsistencies:

- **staleTime**: Controls when data is considered stale (0 for processing, 30s for completed)
- **gcTime**: How long to keep unused data in cache (30s)
- **refetchInterval**: Polling frequency (2s for processing, disabled for completed)
- **refetchOnMount/WindowFocus**: Prevent unnecessary refetching for completed files

### Batch State Lifecycle
```text
1. Upload file
2. Split into N parts → Creates N child files with parent_audio_file_id
3. Auto-detection: Count child files with status = PROCESSING or PENDING
4. If count >= 2 → Activate batch overlay
5. Poll current batch file status every 2 seconds
6. When all files reach COMPLETED/FAILED → Set batch isComplete
7. Show "Batch completed" message
8. After 5 seconds → Clear overlay
9. Stop polling (no more processing/pending files to detect)
```
