# Badge Fix Verification

**Date**: October 20, 2025 08:20 UTC

## Current Database State

```
File 15: 1/3 - Kaaritorpantie - Rainer 5min.mp3
  Status: PENDING
  Progress: 73.7%

File 16: 2/3 - Kaaritorpantie - Rainer 5min.mp3
  Status: PENDING
  Progress: 73.7%

File 17: 3/3 - Kaaritorpantie - Rainer 5min.mp3
  Status: COMPLETED
  Progress: 100%
```

## The Fix Applied

**File**: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/FileList.tsx`
**Lines**: 697-702

```typescript
{isBatchMember && (
  <span className={`... ${
    file.status === 'processing'
      ? 'bg-indigo-600 text-white'
      : 'bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-700 dark:bg-indigo-900/40 dark:text-indigo-200'
  }`}>
    {file.status === 'processing' ? 'Processing' : 'Batch'}
  </span>
)}
```

## What You Should See After Refreshing Browser

1. **File 15 (1/3)**:
   - Status badge: "READY TO START" or "PENDING"
   - Batch badge: "Batch" (light indigo)
   - ✅ NO LONGER shows "PROCESSING"

2. **File 16 (2/3)**:
   - Status badge: "PENDING"
   - Batch badge: "Batch" (light indigo)
   - ✅ Correct

3. **File 17 (3/3)**:
   - Status badge: "COMPLETED"
   - Batch badge: NONE (completed files excluded from batch)
   - ✅ Correct

## How to Verify

1. **Refresh browser**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Navigate to**: <http://localhost:3000/audio>
3. **Check the file list**: Look at the small badge next to each filename
4. **Expected**:
   - Files 15, 16: Small "Batch" badge in light purple/indigo
   - File 17: NO batch badge (it's completed)

## The Bug That Was Fixed

**Before (WRONG)**:

```typescript
{file.status === 'processing' ? 'Processing' : isBatchCurrent ? 'Processing' : 'Batch'}
```

This showed "Processing" for File 15 even though its status was PENDING, because `isBatchCurrent` was true.

**After (CORRECT)**:

```typescript
{file.status === 'processing' ? 'Processing' : 'Batch'}
```

Badge now ONLY based on actual file status.

## Summary

✅ **Fix applied**: Removed `isBatchCurrent` check from badge logic
✅ **Database verified**: Files 15, 16 are PENDING, File 17 is COMPLETED
✅ **Expected result**: Files 15, 16 show "Batch", File 17 shows no badge

**Next step**: Refresh your browser and verify the badges match the expected result above.
